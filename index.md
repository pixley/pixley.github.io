# About
I am a Gameplay Programmer living in suburban Atlanta.  I'm currently part of the id Software team.

## Bio
I've been playing video games as my primary hobby since I was in first grade, and I was around computers longer than I can remember.  While I started out mostly playing games on consoles like the Nintendo 64 and Nintendo GameCube, I've moved over to PC gaming almost exclusively, with a small exception for various Nintendo games.  While I'm not the hardest of hardcore (never booted up Dwarf Fortress or EVE Online, for example), I am passionate about the artform and the industry.  I've been working on games professionally since the summer of 2015, and have had a wonderful career thus far.
