I was responsible for gameplay programming, which involved tuning player character movement and creating the ladder, rope swing, and object-pushing systems.  I also contributed to the overall design of the game, which was a task shared by the whole team.\r\n\r\nAfter is a sidescrolling puzzle/adventure game with an emphasis on narrative.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to play After, you can find it on the [UT Austin GAMMA site](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~gamedev/fall-2014/Transient-Games/Release.html).  It is a web build, so the [Unity Web Player](http://unity3d.com/webplayer) is required (sorry, Linux-users!).  You can also find the [trailer on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/113364865).\r\n\r\n### Project Movement (Working Title) (Jan 2015 - Present)  \r\nProject Movement is my team's (different team from After) 3D Game Development Capstone project, being done in Unity 4.6.  I am responsible for gameplay programming, which has involved tuning player character ground movement and building the grapple swing/pull system that is integral to the game.  I also do shader programming, which I'm learning as I go.  I am also responsible for keeping the team straight on Perforce use.\r\n\r\nProject Movement is an over-the-shoulder platformer built around a grapple hook mechanic.  The core design philosophy is that if you're on the ground for an appreciable amount of time, we've done something wrong.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to play Project Movement, stay tuned for our final release this May!\r\n\r\n### Project Spellsword (Working Title) (Jun 2014 - Present, on hiatus)  \r\nProject Spellsword is a pet project of mine being built in Unreal Engine 4.  Initially developed as a testbed for learning UE4, I ended up spending a lot of time thinking about the concept of a Twin-Stick Metroidvania-style Character Action game.  The initial concept was for it to be a sidescrolling platformer where the player is able to cast magic in all directions around him/her, but that didn't end up feeling right, due to a realization that the setting wouldn't support much verticality, which is vital for sidescrollers, and that the number of enemies that can be in the line of fire at any given time would end up quite low.  That design ended up being scrapped around the time that I got a summer job, and I haven't been free enough since to give it another go.  I would love to come back to it after Project Movement concludes, though, because I love the genre mashup, the world, and using magic and melee weapons at the same time.\r\n\r\n## Technology I Like  \r\nWhile my Capstone projects are Unity games, I really like Unreal Engine 4.  To me, Unity is much more for mobile, casual, or low-power games.  As a PC gamer, I much prefer the power of high-end engines like UE4.  Also, I simply found UE4's workflow a lot more natural.  Blueprints are a lot more flexible than I have found Prefabs to be.  Not to mention that I like C++ more than C#.  I will manage my own memory!  Also, Epic's business model this time around is something I find wonderful from an accessibility standpoint.  That is not to say, however, that I dislike Unity.  What it does well it does very well, and it does lend itself to portability.  I just don't really fall into the market where most Unity games lie.\r\n\r\n## My Favorite Games  \r\nI hold the belief that, if one wants to create games, he/she must understand what makes for good games.\r\n\r\nQuick note: Unless stated otherwise, I think the soundtrack to any game on this list is good enough to have on my primary playlist.\r\n\r\n### Mass Effect 2 and 3  \r\nThe exclusion of ME1 in this heading is not to say it's a bad game, because it's a great game, but there are things that set 2 and 3 apart that make them two of my favorite games of all time.  To me, those games truly understand what RPG means.  As a tabletop gamer, RP means a lot more to me than stats.  It's about choosing how the character interacts with others, how the character carries itself, and what abilities the character has and uses.  All three Mass Effect games have this in spades, and it can certainly be argued that the first game was the best in that regard (though that is not an argument on which I have a strong opinion either way).  What 2 and 3 nail, though, is that they have that and the engrossing setting, but also the gameplay is rock-solid.  Sure, 2 and 3 play like most other cover-based third-person shooters, plus the ability usage, but it is polished, especially in 3's case, and, unlike most cover-shooters, the unlockable abilities, the different character classes, and the different squad compositions keep thing fresh.  Because of that, I have never not finished a playthrough of either ME2 or ME3.\r\n\r\n### Metroid Prime  \r\nMetroid Prime is the first game I can remember definitively saying that it was my favorite.  I'm not about to heap praise on it for flawlessly bringing Metroid to the third dimension, because it was the first Metroid game I ever played.  What engaged me so effectively the first time I played it was the gameplay and how varied it became as the game went on.  I would often get an item and realize that I could use it in a place I had visited before to unlock a new area, and it became obsessive for me to get to the next ability.  While that's still fun, as I've grown older (because I first played it when I was twelve), I've come to appreciate it more.  The game has so much backstory to discover through scanning murals, terminals, and enemies, and that's not something I did the first time.  Going back as an adult, though, I find myself pouring through the journal logs, discovering what the Phazon meteor did to the Chozo on Tallon IV and what the Space Pirates have been doing with Phazon and Metroids.  It's this mystery to uncover as the game progresses, and I love it.  Also, Samus Aran is a boss.  She just is.\r\n\r\n### XCOM: Enemy Within  \r\nXCOM: Enemy Unknown is in a genre in which I own no other games.  Tactics games aren't something that draw me in all that much.  However, XCOM features something I find very engrossing: emergent character story.  To the game, the randomly generate soldiers XCOM hires are just stats and a small amount of customization.  However, the events that transpire during missions give flavor to every single soldier.  For example, I once had a Heavy soldier who missed almost every shot I ever ordered him to take.  His aim stat was just that bad, but he was the only Heavy I had at that point, due to it being early in that particular run, so I kept him on, since he didn't die like Rookies are wont to do.  When he was promoted to Sergeant, thus gaining the ability to be nicknamed, I called him \"Broadside\", as in, something of a barn he could not even hit.  I take great pride in coming up with names that fit the accomplishments and idiosyncrasies of each soldier.  So, when they die, though the game is basically like \"Oh, a soldier died, that was not optimal,\" I'm sitting in my chair mourning their loss.  Now, why is Enemy Within the header instead of Enemy Unknown?  Because it is crazy satisfying to punch a alien gorilla monster in the face with a giant rocket fist.\r\n\r\n### I might add more games when I have time.\r\n\r\n## Games That Don't Quite Hit the Mark  \r\nIn addition to knowing what makes games great, I also believe it is important to consider what holds some games back.\r\n\r\n### [Under Construction]","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
