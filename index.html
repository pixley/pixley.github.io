<a id="what-im-about" class="anchor" href="#what-im-about" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What I'm About</h2>

<p>I am a serious PC gamer, not hardcore enough to play the likes of EVE Online or Dwarf Fortress, but definitely serious about the platform and its future.  I care a lot about games as an art form and about the games industry, and that's why I develop games.  Thus far, I've found myself primarily focusing on gameplay programming.  I find it very rewarding to build an engaging mechanic from the ground up.  I find myself eagerly awaiting tech like virtual reality as a means of engrossing the player.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/B6Y5RyE.png" alt="The player character climbs down a ladder to explore the environment."></p>

<p>After was my team's 2D Game Development Capstone project, done in Unity 4.5.  I was responsible for gameplay programming, which involved tuning player character movement and creating the ladder, rope swing, and object-pushing systems.  I also contributed to the overall design of the game, which was a task shared by the whole team.</p>

<p>After is a sidescrolling puzzle/adventure game with an emphasis on narrative.</p>

<p>If you'd like to play it, you can find <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/%7Egamedev/fall-2014/Transient-Games/Release.html">After on the UT Austin GAMMA site</a>.  It is a web build, so the <a href="http://unity3d.com/webplayer">Unity Web Player</a> is required (sorry, Linux-users!).  You can also find the <a href="https://vimeo.com/113364865">trailer on Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>Hangtime was my team's 3D Game Development Capstone project, done in Unity 4.6.  I was primarily responsible for gameplay and shader programming.  Though I did not serve as the designer on the team, the original idea for a game about swinging from a grapple device was mine.  As gameplay programmer, I developed the swinging mechanic, first experimenting with a PhysX-based solution, then transitioning to a completely script-driven one.  I could probably write multiple paragraphs on why the physics joints didn't work.  While the shader that defined the look of our game was not written by me, I ended up taking on its maintenance and developing more shaders based on it, such as the water and lava shaders, which define the sinusoidal movement of the surfaces to which they're attached.</p>

<p>As for the game itself, Hangtime is an over-the-shoulder 3D platformer based almost entirely around the swinging mechanic.  The design philosophy we've had from the beginning is that if the player is on the ground, or motionless, for any appreciable amount of time, we've done something wrong.</p>

<p>If you'd like to play Hangtime, stay tuned for our final release on Windows, Mac, and Linux May 14th!</p>

<p>Faiurbulz and Swaurdz was my team's Game Technology final project, developed on a custom engine that employs Ogre3D, Bullet, SDL Audio, and CEGUI.  For the engine, my focus was on Bullet integration and construction of the Unity-like component-based system we use for objects in the game.  For the game itself, I took the lead on the gameplay, as I also served as lead designer on the project.</p>

<p>F&amp;S is a goofy top-down omni-directional shooter that also employs melee combat.  The player plays as a spellblade (a person who fights with magic and melee weapons) as they fend off hordes of knights and wizards, who are offended by your combination of their arts.</p>

<p>If you'd like to play Faiurbulz and Swaurds, stay tuned for our final release on Linux May 14th!</p>

<p>Project Spellsword is a pet project of mine being built in Unreal Engine 4.  Initially developed as a testbed for learning UE4, I ended up spending a lot of time thinking about the concept of a Twin-Stick Metroidvania-style Character Action game.  The initial concept was for it to be a sidescrolling platformer where the player is able to cast magic in all directions around him/her, but that didn't end up feeling right, due to a realization that the setting wouldn't support much verticality, which is vital for sidescrollers, and that the number of enemies that can be in the line of fire at any given time would end up quite low.  That design ended up being scrapped around the time that I got a summer job, and I haven't been free enough since to give it another go.  I would love to come back to it after Project Movement concludes, though, because I love the genre mashup, the world, and using magic and melee weapons at the same time.</p>

<a id="technology-i-like" class="anchor" href="#technology-i-like" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Technology I Like</h2>

<p>While my Capstone projects are Unity games, I really like Unreal Engine 4.  To me, Unity is much more for mobile, casual, or low-power games.  As a PC gamer, I much prefer the power of high-end engines like UE4.  Also, I simply found UE4's workflow a lot more natural.  Blueprints are a lot more flexible than I have found Prefabs to be.  Not to mention that I like C++ more than C#.  I will manage my own memory!  Also, Epic's business model this time around is something I find wonderful from an accessibility standpoint.  That is not to say, however, that I dislike Unity.  What it does well it does very well, and it does lend itself to portability.  I just don't really fall into the market where most Unity games lie, Guns of Icarus Online and Shroud of the Avatar being notable exceptions.</p>

<a id="my-favorite-games" class="anchor" href="#my-favorite-games" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My Favorite Games</h2>

<p>I hold the belief that, if one wants to create games, he/she must understand what makes for good games.</p>

<p>Quick note: Unless stated otherwise, I think the soundtrack to any game on this list is good enough to have on my primary playlist.</p>

<h3>
<a id="mass-effect-2-and-3" class="anchor" href="#mass-effect-2-and-3" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mass Effect 2 and 3</h3>

<p>The exclusion of ME1 in this heading is not to say it's a bad game, because it's a great game, but there are things that set 2 and 3 apart that make them two of my favorite games of all time.  To me, those games truly understand what RPG means.  As a tabletop gamer, RP means a lot more to me than stats.  It's about choosing how the character interacts with others, how the character carries itself, and what abilities the character has and uses.  All three Mass Effect games have this in spades, and it can certainly be argued that the first game was the best in that regard (though that is not an argument on which I have a strong opinion either way).  What 2 and 3 nail, though, is that they have that and the engrossing setting, but also the gameplay is rock-solid.  Sure, 2 and 3 play like most other cover-based third-person shooters, plus the ability usage, but it is polished, especially in 3's case, and, unlike most cover-shooters, the unlockable abilities, the different character classes, and the different squad compositions keep thing fresh.  Because of that, I have never not finished a playthrough of either ME2 or ME3.</p>

<h3>
<a id="metroid-prime" class="anchor" href="#metroid-prime" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Metroid Prime</h3>

<p>Metroid Prime is the first game I can remember definitively saying that it was my favorite.  I'm not about to heap praise on it for flawlessly bringing Metroid to the third dimension, because it was the first Metroid game I ever played.  What engaged me so effectively the first time I played it was the gameplay and how varied it became as the game went on.  I would often get an item and realize that I could use it in a place I had visited before to unlock a new area, and it became obsessive for me to get to the next ability.  While that's still fun, as I've grown older (because I first played it when I was twelve), I've come to appreciate it more.  The game has so much backstory to discover through scanning murals, terminals, and enemies, and that's not something I did the first time.  Going back as an adult, though, I find myself pouring through the journal logs, discovering what the Phazon meteor did to the Chozo on Tallon IV and what the Space Pirates have been doing with Phazon and Metroids.  It's this mystery to uncover as the game progresses, and I love it.  Also, Samus Aran is a boss.  She just is.</p>

<h3>
<a id="xcom-enemy-within" class="anchor" href="#xcom-enemy-within" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>XCOM: Enemy Within</h3>

<p>XCOM: Enemy Unknown is in a genre in which I own no other games.  Tactics games aren't something that draw me in all that much.  However, XCOM features something I find very engrossing: emergent character story.  To the game, the randomly generate soldiers XCOM hires are just stats and a small amount of customization.  However, the events that transpire during missions give flavor to every single soldier.  For example, I once had a Heavy soldier who missed almost every shot I ever ordered him to take.  His aim stat was just that bad, but he was the only Heavy I had at that point, due to it being early in that particular run, so I kept him on, since he didn't die like Rookies are wont to do.  When he was promoted to Sergeant, thus gaining the ability to be nicknamed, I called him "Broadside", as in, something of a barn he could not even hit.  I take great pride in coming up with names that fit the accomplishments and idiosyncrasies of each soldier.  So, when they die, though the game is basically like "Oh, a soldier died, that was not optimal," I'm sitting in my chair mourning their loss.  Now, why is Enemy Within the header instead of Enemy Unknown?  Because it is crazy satisfying to punch a alien gorilla monster in the face with a giant rocket fist.</p>

<h3>
<a id="portal-2" class="anchor" href="#portal-2" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Portal 2</h3>

<p>The original Portal was a great game.  It's fun, challenging, and witty.  Portal 2 took everything that made Portal 1 great and did it even better.  More puzzles, more hilarious characters (more in both quality and extent) taunting you over the PA, more world-building, more physics-bending mechanics, and more players.  The first time I played it, I did it in one sitting.  It was just that good, well, and it's short enough to do that.  A lot of games try to be funny, and it can come across as trying too hard, or it could go the "LOL SO RANDOM" route, but Portal 2 hits the mark.  It is one of two games I've ever had to pause to laugh at something it did intentionally.  JK Simmons, Stephen Merchant, and Ellen McLain all hit their performances out of the park.</p>

<h3>
<a id="far-cry-blood-dragon" class="anchor" href="#far-cry-blood-dragon" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Far Cry: Blood Dragon</h3>

<p>This is the other game I've ever needed to stop to laugh at.  I can tell that the devs really poured their hearts into that game.  The 80s references, the over-the-top weapons, and the fantastically funny dialogue all make for a very fun experience.  Of course, someone who hasn't seen a lot of cheesy 80s action movies probably wouldn't appreciate it, but it is an example of one of my favorite philosophies about creating art: the <em>right</em> people will get it.  Joel Hodgson was right when he said that about obscure references in Mystery Science Theater 3000, and I very much believe the same of Blood Dragon.  The game is just pure fun, and I can dig it.  It's one of four games I've ever 100-percented.</p>

<p>In addition to knowing what makes games great, I also believe it is important to consider what holds some games back.</p>

<h3>
<a id="mass-effect-1" class="anchor" href="#mass-effect-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mass Effect 1</h3>

<p>There are a few reasons why I hold Mass Effect's sequels higher than the original game.  The biggest one is the combat gameplay.  Whereas in the other two games, where the player pushes a button to enter and exit cover, ME1 uses a sticky-cover system, which is often finicky.  I much prefer being able to make the decision myself as to when I crouch behind cover, and, luckily, this was recognized and rectified for the sequels.  One other thing that drives me nuts in ME1 is how autosaves can be in the dumbest places.  For example, the end of the mission in which you recruit Liara on Therum has the party get onto an elevator, have a conversation, ride the elevator for 30 seconds, watch a krogan and his merry band of geth walk out, have a conversation with the krogan, and then combat ensues.  Sure.  Fine.  But, that particular fight can be somewhat challenging, so the player will likely die on the first try.  The last possible save (because one can't save manually during combat, cutscenes, conversations, or elevator rides) is the autosave before the conversation at the bottom of the elevator, which means that all that has to happen again, which means, even with skipping every line of dialogue, it'll be about 2 minutes before the combat starts again.</p>

<h3>
<a id="middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor" class="anchor" href="#middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor</h3>

<p>It has a quick-time event instead of a final boss fight.  I was thoroughly enjoying the game until button prompts appeared on my screen to "fight" the final boss.  Three explicitly prompted button presses to win the game.  That is a foul to me.  As a person who enjoys thinking about game mechanics and their implementation, I consider QTEs to be the laziest form of mechanics design.  And this is in a game that has such a good combat system!  If the game had gone to its final cutscene after the huge fight against my nemesis, I would have been very happy.  Even the fight after the nemesis fight was creative and would have been a good note on which to end.  Let's put it this way: people were upset over the ending to Mass Effect 3.  I personally didn't mind that, but I was angry at the ending to Shadow of Mordor.  At least ME3's ending was centered around the most engaging part of the game (conversations).</p>
