# Introduction

## 21 July 2020

With Rogue Company finally coming out from under NDA with the beta release, I felt like it was time to freshen up this site.  Thus far, it's been pretty much just been a glorified resume, but I'd like it to be something more.  This blog is a way to achieve that.

So what do I want this site to be?  In addition to its existing job, I would also like for it to be a way for those outside the industry to get a peek inside, but instead of at the high level that things like [Noclip](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0fDG3byEcMtbOqPMymDNbw) provides, this is about my personal experience as just one person in the industry.  That's not to knock on Noclip, by the way.  They do amazing work.

As for what my experience is, I've been in the games industry for five years now.  I went to the University of Texas at Austin to pursue a Computer Science degree.  Along the way, I got a certificate in game development from the [program formerly known as GAMMA](https://sites.utexas.edu/gaming/).  As part of the GAMMA curriculum, I worked on three games, all as part of a team.  Those games gave me the experience necessary to get my foot in the door of the games industry.

My first job out of college was with Descendent Studios, a Texas-based startup founded by a handful of folks who had left the Austin studio of Cloud Imperium Games (the studio behind Star Citizen).  They were Kickstarting a Unreal 4-powered revival of the Descent series, of which I hadn't heard of prior, but the concept interested me.  I served as the sole gameplay and UI programmer.

Unfortunately, Descendent didn't end up being sustainable.  Though we did make good progress on what was then known as Descent: Underground, the Kickstarter money and the Steam Early Access money wasn't enough to keep the company afloat, and we had a lot of difficulty finding a publisher.  After almost two years on the team, I had to find new work.  The team continued and did find a publisher, but that has since failed to work out.

That work came in the form of Hi-Rez Studios, based in suburban Atlanta.  Hi-Rez was taking their first steps into UE4 development in the form of Smite Tactics, which would later be renamed Hand of the Gods.  Though I was initially hired on for gameplay, I was quickly shifted over to UI to help with a complete rebuild, since I had come in as the person with the most experience with UE4's built-in UI package: UMG.  I worked on Tactics UI for four months, which included the open beta launch.

However, a new project was lurking.  HotG, as a card game made by a 20-ish person team, was just the first step, but Hi-Rez wanted a proper UE4 project to stand alongside Smite and Paladins.  I was among the first ten people to form the new team that would go on to create Rogue Company.  As of writing, I've been working on RoCo for just shy of three years, and the team has grown immensely since those initial days.

But that all is just a summary of my career thus far.  Much of this blog will reflect on the details of those stories, including how I got into the industry, what happened to Descent, adjusting to the larger teams at Hi-Rez, and plenty more.  In addition, I'll likely touch on topics that folks outside the industry might not know so much about, like what different kinds of roles there are (for example, technical artists are heroes).

I don't plan on maintaining a regular schedule or anything.  I'll write when I feel like it.  In the meantime, stay safe, wear a mask, and [give RoCo a try](https://www.roguecompany.com) (Available on Windows via Epic Games Store, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch).
